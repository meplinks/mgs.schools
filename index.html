        <h1><b>are Welcome to MEPLINKS GREATER SCHOOLS page</b>
        </h1>
        <p><b>I want to extend to you and your family a very warm welcome to Meplinks Greater Schools.  The middle years are an exciting time when children embark upon new adventures in the world of learning.  Each year will provide important transitions and the acquisition of new skills that will enhance each student’s ability to apply learning in many ways.  MeplinksGreater Schools is committed to providing a challenging and rigorous curriculum that helps each student progress at a developmentally appropriate rate and provides a safe environment for all students. 
          “In this life we cannot do great things. We can only do small things with great love.” - Mother Teresa
          In her quote, Mother Teresa very powerfully captures important wisdom about how to approach life (and schooling) to make it more fulfilling and significant.  Teaching and learning offers us all numerous opportunities to focus on a number of “small things” that culminate over time to produce students that are prepared to do the “great things” of life.  With this in mind, ultimately as a school community we are judged by the actions of our students and the way new student learning connects and impacts the world beyond our school.   As a MGS. school, we are committed to integrating the arts into learning opportunities because we believe that we learn better with and through the arts.  Our mission statement reflects this commitment:
          “With the support of staff and families, MGS students explore, express and excel academically and creatively. In partnership with our community, we integrate the arts to ignite enthusiasm, deepen understanding, and enhance learning for every student.”
          As the Proprietor of Meplinks Greater School, I believe that it is my responsibility to maintain and to continue to build a supportive and collaborative spirit at our school.  Together as a school community, we will build on the traditions of the past and meet the challenges of the future in innovative and exciting ways.
          Sincerely,
          Ayodele Ogunboyo
